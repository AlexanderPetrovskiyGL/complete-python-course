# Complete Python Course

Welcome to the Complete Python Course!

This could will give you a strong Python foundation, and show you most features of the language and what Python has to offer.

It will take you from the very basics of coding, such as variables and expressions, all the way to advanced object-oriented programming, algorithms, and data structures.

At the end of the course we'll also show you how to use popular third-party libraries to build projects, such as to:

- Perform web scraping
- Browser automation with Selenium
- Create web services with `flask`
- Interact with other APIs using `requests`
- Build desktop apps with Tkinter
- Add unit tests to your applications with `unittest`

The e-book, this very thing you're reading right now, is a work in progress. Most of the course content is available exclusively on Udemy. This e-book is something we're working on to help our Udemy students learn.
