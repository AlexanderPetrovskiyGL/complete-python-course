# Decorators in Python

Decorators allow us to extend another function without modifying it directly.

The video course goes into a lot of detail. You can see this in the [lectures](https://github.com/tecladocode/complete-python-course/tree/master/course_contents/17_decorators/lectures/).

We've also made a [full free mini-course on decorators](https://blog.teclado.com/decorators-in-python/)!
