# Course Introduction

Welcome to the very first section of the **[Complete Python Course](https://go.tecla.do/complete-python-sale)**! This section is for complete beginners to Python and coding.

We'll cover:

- Variables, numbers
- String formatting
- User input
- Booleans
- Lists, tuples, sets
- Dictionaries

On the left hand side you'll see a table of contents with all the lectures for which we have written an e-book page. At the moment, since this e-book is new, that's just the [`and` and `or` lecture](/intro/lectures/and_or/). More coming soon!

You can see the [lectures](https://github.com/tecladocode/complete-python-course/tree/master/course_contents/1_intro/lectures) folder for a break down of all the topics and the code in each.

In the [notes](https://github.com/tecladocode/complete-python-course/tree/master/course_contents/1_intro/notes) folder you can download Markdown or PDF cheatsheets to help you remember some key points.
